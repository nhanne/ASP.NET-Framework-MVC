This project uses an architectural pattern: framework ASP.NET MVC, model mapping databases from SQL Server with a modern ORM, which is Entity Framework, UX/UI designed by Figma, and done with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Utilize programming languages such as C# OOP to retrieve and handle data by LINQ-to-entities or entity-SQL, then return ViewResult or JsonResult on functions such as CRUD (Restful APIs). Call AJAX JQuery after using JavaScripts DOM to request the server for some functions that donâ€™t require reloading the page. In addition, there is an integrated SignalR for real-time communication between the client and server. Write APIs from Momo and VnPay for the online payment.
